## \*\*\* No decryption issues \*\*\*
The implementation of `YFinance.jl` is similar to the python package `yahooquery` in that it accesses data through API endpoints. Therefore, **`YFinance.jl` does not experience the same decryption issues** that pythonâ€™s `yfinance` faces at the moment.

## What you can download
- Price data (including intraday)
- Fundamental data
- Option Data
- ESG Data
- quoteSummary data (this is a JSON3.object that contains a multitude of different information)
