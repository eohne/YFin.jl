*Download price, fundamental, and option data from Yahoo Finance*  
This is a side project and my first package so do not expect too much.

## \*\*\* No decryption issues \*\*\*
The implementation of `YFinance.jl` is similar to the python package `yahooquery` in that it accesses data through API endpoints. Therefore, **`YFinance.jl` does not experience the same decryption issues** that pythonâ€™s `yfinance` faces at the moment.

## What you can download
- Price data (including intraday)
- Fundamental data
- Option Data
- ESG Data
- quoteSummary data (this is a JSON3.object that contains a multitude of different information)

## Precompilation across different versions

### Version 0.1.10 
Precompiles only the response processing part of the `get_prices` function and not the HTTP request. Most of the compilation time lies unfortunately with the request itself.  
To Install this version enter the package mode by entering `]` in the REPL and run the following command:
```julia
  (@v1.10) pkg> add YFinance
```

### Version 0.1.9 
Does not precompile.  
To Install this version enter the package mode by entering `]` in the REPL and run the following command:
```julia
  (@v1.10) pkg> add YFinance @v0.1.9
```

### Version 0.1.8 
Precompilation of the `get_prices` function. This has caused precompilation hangs for Julia 1.10 and 1.11 - package typically still precompiles but takes long and gives warnings. One user at least has reported errors. Note precompilation also does not work if you require to set a proxy to access the internet. 

To Install this version enter the package mode by entering `]` in the REPL and run the following command:
```julia
(@v1.10) pkg> add YFinance @v0.1.8
```
